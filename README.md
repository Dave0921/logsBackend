### Parameters:

Headers:
    'Content-Type: application/json'
 
Example JSON data format:
```json

#### Successful Response:
The user ids have been successfully created. Note that if some or all the user ids already existed, the response will still be successful.

Follow Up Question
===============

How do we make this solution cloud-scalable?
------

The current requirements ask for around 100 users sending logs every 5 minutes, which means a single MySQL database and single REST API for sending logs should be sufficient. However, if there were up to 10K users simultaneously sending logs at any moment and the querying of millions of data points, then we may need to change the ways we upload and retrieve logs.

In order to support many users sending log requests simultaneously, there are some options:

#### Supporting batch requests
* This allows for a faster response for multiple requests compared to making single requests multiple times.
#### Concurrent processing of batch requests
* Rather than synchronously processing every request, asynchronously enqueue the request into a queue of requests.
* Workers will dequeue requests from the queue and process them, storing the data into a database and then send responses back to the client.
#### Storing and Sharding the logs in a NoSQL database; for example Cassandra
* This allows the storage of millions or even billions of logs.
